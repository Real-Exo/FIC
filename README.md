FIC compares a MASTER filetree with a SLAVE filetree.
A MASTER or SLAVE can be a directory, a ZIP file or a checksum list file generated earlier with FIC.
MASTER serves as the source for the files to be compared. Any MASTER files that are not available in SLAVE
are logged as not available. Any SLAVE files that are not available in MASTER are ignored.
